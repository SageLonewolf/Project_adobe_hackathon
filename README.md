# ðŸ“˜ PDF Outline & Title Extractor (Adobe Hackathon 2025)

This project uses a Machine Learning pipeline to extract a structured outline (`H1`, `H2`, etc.) and document title from PDF files. It is designed to handle a wide range of documents â€” from highly structured reports to simple flyers and forms.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

-  ML-based heading classification (`Title`, `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4`)
-  JSON output schema as per challenge requirement
-  Dockerized for easy reproducibility and submission
-  Works on real-world noisy PDFs

---

## ðŸ§¾ JSON Output Schema

{
  "title": "Document Title",
  "outline": [
    {
      "level": "H1",
      "text": "Section Heading",
      "page": 1
    }
  ]
}
